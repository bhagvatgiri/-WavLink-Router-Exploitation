### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

We managed to find this RCE vulnerability on March 29th. Unfortunately, someone else discovered the same vulnerability and published it before this project was over: https://stigward.medium.com/wavlink-command-injection-cve-2022-23900-51988f6f15df.

However, unlike the Proof of Concept (POC) in that blog post, we thought to combine it with the unauthenticated settings export, so you can directly perform the shell injection instead of performing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
