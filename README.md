# WavLink-Router-Exploitation
## Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to remotely compromise a home router. After compromising
the router, we plan to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to manipulate traffic and create
a persistent backdoor. If time permits, we also plan to perform Internet scans to
determine how many devices are affected by our exploit

## Project Description
We compromised a home-grade wireless router: WAVLINK AC1200. We used
information gained through hardware interfaces to extract its firmware. After that, we
performed a vulnerability research (VR) phase. We leveraged the extracted
firmware image to create a proof-of-concept remote exploit against the router on either
the LAN or the WAN interfaces.
In a post-exploitation phase we utilized the remote code execution (RCE) exploit
to perform man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks. This will allow us to redirect computers to
different websites (non-HTTPS) or sinkhole traffic to certain websites. Furthermore, the
firmware does not appear to have a digital signature. Therefore, we successfully attempted to use
our access to craft and flash a backdoored firmware image.
The exploits do provide unauthenticated RCE. If attacking from the LAN, we have
assumed that we have valid credentials to the WiFi network, but that we do not have
credentials for administrative interfaces on the router. All tests were performed against
the latest firmware versions of these routers, and we successfully attempted to find novel
vulnerabilities that have not already been published.
We also perfomed Internet scans to determine approximately how many devices are vunerable to the exploit we found.
